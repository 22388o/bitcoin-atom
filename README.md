What is Bitcoin Atom (BCA) ?
----------------

Bitcoin Atom (BCA) is a SegWit enabled Bitcoin fork with on-chain atomic swaps on board and hybrid consensus. Bitcoin Atom enables truly decentralized digital asset exchange by utilizing hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs) and its own HTLC API, giving independence from intermediaries and any centralized entities.

Bitcoin Atom is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain with major protocol upgrades that occurred in January (block number 505 888). Bitcoin Atom’s development team is working on a special embedded toolkit for both on-chain and off-chain atomic swaps, allowing for exchanging any cryptocurrencies in a hassle-free way across different blockchains.

The Bitcoin Atom (BCA) fork took place at block #505888 on January 24, 2018.
